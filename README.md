## Overview

**Zenith — The Celestial Eye** is a real-time interactive orbital observatory built to answer one core question:

> **What is happening in the sky above any place on Earth right now?**

With Zenith you can:

- Interact with a fully navigable **3D globe**
- Click or search **any location on Earth**
- Inspect **real-time sky conditions** (cloud cover, visibility, moon phase, visible planets)
- Track **live orbital satellites** by category (ISS, GPS, weather, Starlink, Iridium)
- Monitor **ISS position and upcoming passes**
- Visualize **orbital congestion / traffic density** across the planet

Rather than presenting raw API responses on a plain dashboard, Zenith turns celestial and orbital data into an immersive, mission-control-style observatory experience.

## Problem Statement

The night sky above us is shaped by several independent layers of information: weather and cloud cover, moon phase and visibility, visible planets, satellite traffic, ISS overhead passes, and the growing congestion caused by modern satellite constellations.

Most existing tools surface only **one layer at a time** — weather, astronomy, *or* satellites. Zenith unifies all of them into a single interactive platform, so a user can explore both:

1. **What a person can observe** from a given location, and
2. **What is happening in orbit** above that location.

## Why Zenith

| | |
|---|---|
| 🌍 **Interactive 3D Earth observatory** | Powered by `react-globe.gl` / Three.js |
| 🌦️ **Location-based sky intelligence** | Live weather + astronomy context per coordinate |
| 🛰️ **Real-time satellite & ISS tracking** | Multiple orbital categories, live propagation |
| 🔥 **Orbital Lens** | Congestion / density heatmap of orbital traffic |
| 🎬 **Mission-style UI** | Cosmic storytelling and observatory theming |
| 📱 **Fully responsive** | Desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts |
| ⚡ **Single-app architecture** | One Next.js + TypeScript codebase, no separate backend |

## Core Features

### 1. Launch Observatory — Interactive 3D Globe
A full-screen 3D globe where users can rotate and zoom around Earth, click any coordinate, search a city/region/landmark, switch between orbital layers, and open different observatory intelligence modes. This is the main entry point into the experience.

### 2. Location Intelligence / Celestial Atlas
Selecting a location generates a location-specific observatory profile, including city/country/region, lat/lon, timezone and local time, cloud cover, visibility, moon phase, visible planets, a sky quality score, orbital congestion context, satellites overhead, and the next ISS pass for that place.

### 3. Real-Time Satellite Tracking
Inspect orbital categories — **Stations/ISS, GPS/Navigation, Weather Satellites, Starlink, Iridium** — with telemetry including name + NORAD ID, live propagated lat/lon, altitude, velocity, inclination, TLE epoch/freshness, and observability status.

### 4. ISS Mission Mode
A dedicated tracking experience showing live ISS position, orbital state, altitude and velocity, and pass predictions for a selected location.

### 5. Orbital Lens — Space Congestion Heatmap
Visualizes orbital traffic *density* across Earth (rather than isolated satellite markers) to help answer: **where is orbital space currently most crowded?** Highlights dense orbital corridors and how congestion shifts at a planetary scale.

### 6. Cosmic Time Machine
A narrative visualization module contrasting quieter historical orbital eras with the modern orbital boom and projected future congestion — giving Zenith both operational and educational value.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- Next.js (App Router) · React · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS · Framer Motion · `react-globe.gl` (Three.js)

**Data / Orbital / Astronomy Layer**
- `satellite.js` · Astronomy Engine · custom telemetry aggregation utilities

**Backend**
- Implemented entirely as Next.js Route Handlers with server-side utilities and in-app caching/refresh logic — **no separate Python/FastAPI backend**.

## Architecture

Zenith is intentionally built as a single-app observatory platform:

```text
User interacts with Zenith
   ↓
3D Globe / Search / Observatory controls
   ↓
Location selection or satellite selection
   ↓
Next.js route handlers fetch & aggregate live data from:
   - CelesTrak
   - Open-Meteo
   - Nominatim
   - Astronomy Engine
   ↓
Data is normalized into observatory telemetry payloads
   ↓
Zenith renders feature-specific UI:
   - Location Atlas
   - Satellite Mode
   - ISS Mode
   - Orbital Lens
   - Time Machine
```

**Feature walkthrough**

- **Landing Experience** — introduces Zenith's identity and the Cosmic Time Machine, with entry into the Launch Observatory.
- **Launch Observatory** — full-screen mode with the 3D globe, search, layer toggles, satellite markers, and mission console overlays.
- **Location selection flow** — click/search a place → Zenith captures coordinates → resolves name + telemetry → observatory UI updates.
- **Satellite selection flow** — select an orbital object → switch to satellite telemetry mode → display live propagated orbital state.
- **Orbital Lens flow** — activate the lens → compute congestion patterns → render heatmap overlays.

## Project Structure

> File names may evolve during UI refactors, but the structure stays organized around observatory features and route-level data fetching.

```

**Getting a Cesium Ion token:**
1. Go to [ion.cesium.com](https://ion.cesium.com/) and create a free account.
2. Navigate to **Access Tokens** in the sidebar.
3. Click **Create Token**, then copy it into `NEXT_PUBLIC_CESIUM_ION_TOKEN`.

## API Routes

| Route | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/telemetry` | Location-based observatory intelligence: cloud cover, visibility, moon phase, visible planets, sky quality, orbital observability metrics |
| `GET /api/iss` | Live ISS position and orbital telemetry |
| `GET /api/iss-pass` | ISS pass prediction for a selected location |
| `GET /api/satellites/[category]` | Satellite category datasets — `stations`, `gps`, `weather`, `starlink`, `iridium` |

## Real-Time Data Sources

| Source | Used For |
|---|---|
| **[CelesTrak](https://celestrak.org/)** | Satellite category feeds, TLE/orbital element sets, ISS orbital projection data — powers live propagation, the custom ISS prediction engine, and orbital visualization |
| **[Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/)** | Cloud cover, visibility, and timezone-related context — determines whether the sky is actually viewable from a location |
| **[Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/) / OpenStreetMap** | Reverse geocoding — converts coordinates into human-readable place, city, country, and region names |
| **[Astronomy Engine](https://github.com/cosinekitty/astronomy)** | Moon phase, illumination, and visible-planet calculations based on observer coordinates |
| **`react-globe.gl`** (Three.js) | The interactive 3D globe, geospatial rendering, and camera navigation |
| **Custom ISS Pass Engine** (`satellite.js`) | Native 24-hour orbital projection engine built in-house — avoids rate-limited third-party APIs like Open Notify by computing overhead ISS passes server-side from CelesTrak TLE data |

> Additional services may be integrated as the project grows, but the above are the primary engines powering the current Zenith stack.

## Data Pipeline

1. **User selects a location** — clicks a coordinate or searches for a place.
2. **Zenith resolves place + sky context** — route handlers fetch location metadata from Nominatim, weather/visibility from Open-Meteo, celestial context from Astronomy Engine, and ISS/orbital context where relevant.
3. **Zenith builds a telemetry payload** — a single object containing place info, coordinates, timezone/local time, cloud cover, visibility, moon phase, visible planets, sky quality signals, and orbital/ISS context.
4. **Frontend renders the observatory UI** — the payload populates the Location Atlas, ISS/Satellite mode, or Orbital Lens overlays, depending on the active mode.

## Responsive Design Strategy

| Breakpoint | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Desktop** | Full-screen 3D globe with rich, multi-zone side panels and overlays |
| **Tablet** | Reduced spacing and rebalanced panels while preserving observatory hierarchy |
| **Mobile** | Adaptive overlays/sheets, vertically stacked intelligence layouts, touch-friendly controls and search |

**Layout techniques:** Flexbox, CSS Grid, responsive Tailwind breakpoints, and conditional rendering for stacked UI zones on smaller screens.

## Performance & Refresh Strategy

- Feature-based UI separation and selective satellite-layer rendering
- Cached / revalidated orbital datasets
- Client-side orbital propagation instead of constant full-server recomputation
- Route-level fetching for observatory data
- Refresh intervals tuned per data type:

| Signal | Refresh Cadence |
|---|---|
| ISS position | Frequent |
| Weather / cloud cover | Moderate |
| Moon phase / visible planets | Slow |
| TLE / satellite layer datasets | Cached, periodic |

## Roadmap

- [ ] Constellation overlays
- [ ] Side-by-side location sky comparison
- [ ] Orbital history playback
- [ ] Aurora / meteor shower awareness
- [ ] Saved observatory locations
- [ ] Public observatory event / educational mode
